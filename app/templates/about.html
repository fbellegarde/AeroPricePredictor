<h1>About Our ML & Generative AI</h1>
<p>The **AeroPricePredictor** uses a **Content-Based Recommender System** trained on historical flight attributes (destination, time of year, airline) to predict future price trends.</p>
<p>Generative AI (specifically a **Markov Chain**) is used to create dynamic, flight-themed slogans for a more engaging user experience.</p>
<p>This entire system is built and deployed using modern **Cloud Architecture (AWS/GCP/Azure via Terraform)**, showcasing a robust, full-stack application pipeline.</p>
